# OpenLottery

## Join the Team

I am looking to learn from people who know more than me. If you are or know someone who is active in the DeFi world in operations, security, tokenomics, or development, I would love to hear from you! The right people could even get into the DAO and earn a piece of the action.

## What is the Open Lottery?

Simply put, a DeFi/Web3 app that allows players to create their own automated, provably fair lotteries, promote them, and profit. Players can of course also play in these lotteries and (at least now) it is winner take all!

## This is the JavaScript/React/Web3 part of the software
