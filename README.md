## Creating a lottery

In order to create a lottery you set the ticket price, the minimum and maximum players and the date/time when it a winner will be drawn. They click a button and the the contract is "Minted" on the blockchain.

When the contract is minted, a SHA256 is generated to use later for the random number selection and also for the unique Lottery ID.
